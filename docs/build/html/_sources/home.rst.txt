What Is JIRA Exploratory plugin?
===========================================================

To support and enhance your Exploratory testing, we enhanced the simultaneous process of test design, note taking and reporting. You, as a tester, donâ€™t have to change windows, stack pop-ups or go to another tool in order to document and support your learning activities. Everything you need to do is context-based, and available to you on one main screen. There are some cool features of industry curated catalogue and a smart built-in search for better utilization of the exploratory testing syllabus.

What Is It For?
===========================================================
The plugin is designed to do the following:

- Maximize your Exloratory testing
- Empower Effortless lean documentation
- Support Context and Data-driven design

How To Use?
===========================================================
Use this all-in-one toolbox when you want to further improve and extend your test ideas via our search. You can start by adding one of the many templates, with ready to use content and easy flows of assessment, planning and reporting. Once your Exploratory testing charter is structured, use the curated catalogue of heuristics, checklists and mnemonics to support your testing.
